The equivalent circuit is a voltage source with voltage VTh in series with a resistance RTh.<br>
The Thévenin-equivalent voltage VTh is the open-circuit voltage at the output terminals of the original circuit.<br> When calculating a Thévenin-equivalent voltage, the voltage 
divider principle is often useful, by declaring one terminal to be Vout and the other terminal to be at the ground point.<br>
The Thévenin-equivalent resistance RTh is the resistance measured across points A and B "looking back" into the circuit.<br>
 The resistance is measured after replacing all voltage- and current-sources with their internal resistances.<br>
 That means an ideal voltage source The is replaced with a short circuit, and an ideal current source is replaced with an open circuit.<br>
 Resistance can then be calculated across the terminals using the formulae for series and parallel circuits. This method is valid only for <br>
 circuits with independent sources. <br>
 If there are dependent sources in the circuit, another method must be used such as connecting a test source across A and B and calculating the voltage across <br>
 or current through the test source.<br>
The replacements of voltage and current sources do what the sources would do if their values we<br>re set to zero. A zero va<br>
lued voltage source would create a potential<br> difference of zero volts between its terminals, regardless of the current that passes through it; its repla<br>
<br>
cement, a short circuit, does the same thing.<br> A zero valued current source passes zero current, regardless of the voltage across it; <br>its replacement, an open circuit,<br>

originally stated in terms of DC resistive circuits only, Thévenin's theorem holds that:<br>
•	Any linear electrical network containing <br> voltage sources, current sources and resi<br>
stances can be replaced at terminals A-B by an<br> equivalent combination of a voltage source Vth in a series connection wit<br>h a resistance Rth.<br><br>
•	The equivalent voltage Vth is the voltage obtained at terminals A-B of the network with<br>
 terminals A-B open circuited.<br>
•	The equivalent resistance Rth is the resistance that the circuit between terminals A an<br>
d B would have if all ideal voltage sources in <br>the circuit were replaced by a short circuit and all ideal current sources<br> were replaced by an open circuit.<br>
•	If terminals A and B are connected to one another, the current flowing from A to B will<br>
 be Vth/Rth. This means that Rth could alternati<br>vely be calculated as Vth divided by the short-circuit current between A and B when they are connected together.<br>
In circuit theory terms, the theorem allows any one-port network to be reduced to a single voltage source and a single impedance<br>
The theorem also applies to frequency domain AC circuits consisting of reactive and <br>
ve impedances. It means the theorem applies for AC in an exactly same way to DC except that resistances are generalized to impedances.<br>
The theorem was independently derived in 1853 by the German scientist Hermann von Helmholtz
 and in 1883 by Léon Charles Thévenin (1857–1926), an electrical engineer with France's national 
 Postes et Télégraphes telecommunications organization. 
Thévenin's theorem and its dual, Norton's theorem, are widely used to make circuit analysis simpler<br>
 and to study a circuit's initial-condition and steady-state response. Thévenin's theorem can be used to c<br>
 onvert any circuit's sources and impedances to a Thévenin equivalent; use of the theorem may in some cases be more conv<br>enient than use of Kirchhoff's circuit laws.
In the previous three tutorials we have looked at solving complex electrical circuits using
 Kirchhoff’s Circ
uit Laws, Mesh Analysis and finally Nodal Analysis. But there are many more “Circuit Analysis 
Theorems” available to choose from which can calculate the currents and voltages at any point 
in a circuit. In this tutorial we will look at one of the more common circuit analysis theorems (next to Kirchhoff´s) th<br>at has been developed, Thevenin’s Theorem.
Thevenin’s Theorem states that “Any linear circuit containing several voltages and 


ces can be replaced by just one single voltage in series with a sing<br>le resistance connected <br>across the load“. In other words, it is possible to simplify any electrical circu
it, no matter how complex, to an equivalent two-terminal circuit wit<br>h just a single constant voltage source in series w<br>ith a resistance (or impedance) conn<br>ected to a load as 
shown below.
Thevenin’s Theorem is especially useful in the circuit analysis of <br>power or battery systems and other interconnected resistive ci<br>rcuits where it will have an effect on the 
<br>
adjoining part of the circuit.
