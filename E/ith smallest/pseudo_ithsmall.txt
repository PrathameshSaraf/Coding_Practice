Run quick sort algorithm on the input array
In this algorithm pick a pivot element and move it to itâ€™s correct position
Now, if index of pivot is equal to K then return the value, else if the index of pivot is greater than K, then recur for the left subarray, else recur for the right subarray 
Repeat this process until the element at index K is not found
